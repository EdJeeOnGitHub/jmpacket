% adapted JMP abstract
In my job market paper, I revisit a central question in development economics:
do poverty traps exist? Using harmonized microdata from 27 randomized controlled
trials covering 75,000 households, I develop a new empirical framework to
estimate their prevalence. I find that while 60\% of studies show signs of
poverty traps, only about a quarter of households are actually trapped---largely
due to differences in productivity and forward-looking consumption. A calibrated
growth model shows that optimal transfer policies reflect this,
targeting the poorest rather than those near the trap threshold.

% rework the transition sentence from your research statement to
In other work, I study health interventions in low-income countries. One project
examines how private costs and social image returns interact in a Kenyan
deworming campaign: as distance to treatment rises, take-up falls, but those who
deworm gain higher social image returns. A structural model shows these returns
can offset private costs, allowing policymakers to space treatment sites farther
apart while maintaining coverage. In related work, I estimate the impact of a
large-scale child immunization program in Pakistan where government programmatic
constraints limited randomization.

% differences in productivity and forward-looking consumption responses which allow
% households to preemptively invest and escape low-asset states. Using a calibrated

% heterogeneity – targeting the poorest households rather than those near the trap
% threshold in a majority of contexts.
